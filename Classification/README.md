## Classification Experiments

### Overview

This directory houses all the code related to classification experiments. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific experiment and includes the necessary settings and configurations.

### Structure

The structure of this directory is organized for clarity and ease of navigation:

- **train_10:** contains the code experiment run with patience of 10 for EarlyStopping criteria.

- **without_pretrained:** contains experiments without using any exisiting weights.

-- **.ipynb** all other files uses `imagenet` weights.

### Usage

To run any of the experiments, follow these steps:

1. Install python `https://python.org/`
2. install all packages included in `requirements` file.
3. Execute `jupyter notebook` file accordingly.

### Best Model weights
